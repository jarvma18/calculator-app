# calculator-app

## Overview
The Calculator App is a simple application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides users with an interface to perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Debugging and Testing

### Debug Build
To create a debug build of the Calculator App, use the following command:
```
flutter build apk --debug
```
This will generate a debug APK that can be installed on an Android device for testing purposes.

### Running Tests
To ensure the app functions as expected, you can run the test suite using:
```
flutter test
```
This will execute all unit and widget tests defined in the project.

## Figma prototype

Idea was to use colors from old school enviroment:
- white chalk (#FFFEF9),
- school chalk board (darker #51906A, lighter #9BCDB0),
- yellow sponge for clearing (#FDFE03),
- wood for equal sign (#FFC18C)
- and background as graphite (#41424C).

Current "UI design" is just a prototype with rough edges. I won't design it further, so next one will be picture of the app UI.

## Figma prototype

Idea was to use colors from old school enviroment:
- white chalk (#FFFEF9),
- school chalk board (darker #51906A, lighter #9BCDB0),
- yellow sponge for clearing (#FDFE03),
- wood for equal sign (#FFC18C)
- and background as graphite (#41424C).

Current "UI design" is just a prototype with rough edges. I won't design it further, so next one will be picture of the app UI.
